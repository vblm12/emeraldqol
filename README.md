# Pokémon Emerald QOL Project

This is a hack project based on the Pokémon Emerald Disassembly. The
goal of this hack is to allow the player to get into the action quickly,
reducing pointless time-sinks where possible while still providing for
challenging battles.

This hack will not make changes to the Gen 3 meta.

Current changes include:

* Running allowed anywhere.
* Make TMs re-usable.
* Allow HMs to be forgotten when learning new moves.
* The RNG seed is set to a different value every boot.
* The player's party is completely healed before and after every battle.
* Bag items are not usable in trainer battles, either by the AI or the player.
* The move tutor has graciously decided to work for free.
* Trainer's underlevel Pokémon will level up with the player's highest level Pokémon.
* Try to make all trainers use the best AI packages.
* The number to subtract from egg cycles per step should be quadrupled.
* Try to make trainers suck less by giving them all better AI packages.
* Reduce the amount of time for berries to grow to 1/10th the original time. Berries also only need to be watered once, and wont die if you take a break.
* Reduce the penalty for losing to 1.3 times the player's money to encourage risk-taking, and compensate for a harder early game.
* Evolve some trainer Pokémon that have been leveled up.
* EV increasing items work until EVs for that stat reach 252 (or the max 510)
* The annoying low-hp beep is removed.
* Potions are useless in this hack. They have been replaced in stores with berries, and other items elsewhere. Dialog has been modified to reflect this change.
* The defaults for new games have changed. Text speed defaults to fast, sound defaults to stereo, and battle-style defaults to set.

Please do file issues to report bugs or suggest improvements.
