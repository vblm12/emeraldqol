# Pokémon Emerald QOL Project

This is a hack project based on the Pokémon Emerald Disassembly. The
goal of this hack is to allow the player to get into the action quickly,
reducing pointless time-sinks where possible while still providing for
challenging battles.

This hack will not make changes to the Gen 3 meta.

Current changes include:

* Running allowed anywhere.
* Make TMs re-usable.
* Allow HMs to be forgotten when learning new moves.
* The RNG is either fixed or even more broken, testing needed
* The player's party is completely healed before and after every battle.
* Bag items are not usable in trainer battles, either by the AI or the player.

Please do file issues to report bugs or suggest improvements.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
